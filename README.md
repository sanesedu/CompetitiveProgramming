# Solutions to Competitive Programming Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various problems and competitions from different Competitive Programming sites. 

The vast majority of them have been accepted by the online judges of those sites, but in order to differentiate them from the ones I am still working on, I have appended a lower-case *'a'* at the end of the problem number to certify that the solution to that problem has indeed been accepted. 

Moreover, inside some of the folders, there is more than one source code file. In those instances, the file(s) corresponding to the solution(s) will be named **'main.cpp'**, **'Main.java'**, or **'sol.py'**.

Currently, I have solutions for the following **sites**:
